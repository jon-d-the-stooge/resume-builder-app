/**
 * Services index - re-exports service modules from main/ for use by backend routes.
 * This provides a clean abstraction layer between the Express routes
 * and the core business logic implemented in the main process modules.
 *
 * Services will be re-exported here as the backend is integrated with
 * the existing Electron main process modules.
 */

// Re-exports from main/ modules will be added here
// e.g., export * from '../../main/services/vaultService';
